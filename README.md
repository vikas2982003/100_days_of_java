# 100_days_of_java
100 Days of Java is my personal coding challenge to practice Java daily. This repo will have 100+ programs covering basics to advanced concepts with problem statements and solutions. All questions are based on real-life problem scenarios instead of dummy examples, making the challenge practical and meaningful.
